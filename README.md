## This is a sample .NET 6 C# REST API project generated by [OnionAPI template](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=workcontrol.VSIXTemplateOnionAPI).   The project is referenced in the blog [Secure .NET CORE 6 Web API with JWT from Duende IdentityServer](https://medium.com/scrum-and-coke/secure-net-core-6-web-api-with-jwt-from-duente-identityserver-adf3518de965?sk=5afefa0b1b12fba4e5f4708d50fb1717) on medium.com.

### Developers can use the Visual Studio template OnionAPI to scaffold a clean architecture REST API solution consisting of five projects

1. Domain - entities and the common models
2. Application - Interfaces, CQRS Features, Exceptions, Behaviors
3. Infrastructure.Persistence - application-specific database access
4. Infrastructure.Shared - common services such as Mail Service, Date Time Service, Mock, and so on
5. WebApi - controllers for REST API resources and endpoints

### The underline tech stack provides loosely-coupled and inverted-dependency architecture with good design patterns and practices.

1. ASP.NET CORE 6 — a framework for creating RESTful services, also known as web APIs, using C#
2. Repository Pattern — abstraction layer between the data access layer and the controller
3. CQRS (Command and Query Responsibility Segregation) Pattern — separating read and update operations for a data store to maximize performance, scalability, and security based on MediatR and AutoMapper
4. Entity Framework Core — a lightweight, extensible, open-source, and cross-platform version of the popular Entity Framework data access technology
5. Swashbuckle — the industry standard for REST API documentation and testing
6. Bogus — a realistic, easy to use mock data .NET library for rapid REST API design and testing
